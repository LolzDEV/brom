Low level programming language (WIP).

## Features
- [X] Natively compiled (LLVM)

## Usage
The compiler only outputs object files (.o) so you need `clang` to link them into an executable.

## Notes
Note that this language is still under development so please don't use it in production. If you want to contribute feel free to send PRs or open Issues.
